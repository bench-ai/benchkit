# _benchkit_

Welcome to `benchkit`! We are an End-To-End Free Machine Learning Model management platform.

We allow users to:

1. Train and deploy their models on the cloud with a fully managed infrastructure (no more cuda headaches 🙃)
2. Track their model runs
3. Graph Model Accuracy, and outputs

## Docs

## How it works

`benchkit` works in sync with the Bench AI site, and is completely free.
